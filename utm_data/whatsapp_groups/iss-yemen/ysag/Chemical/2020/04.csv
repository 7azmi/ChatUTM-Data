This means that we have a 1 D heat conduction problem with heat generation. Since we are concerned with radial directions we have θ and Φ symmetry. This means that no temperature gradient in Φ and θ direction. Simplifications: Steady state means ∂T / ∂t = 0 θ symmetry : ∂T / ∂θ = 0 Φ symmetry : ∂2T / ∂Φ2 = 0 These simplifications reduces the equation to: (1 / r2) ∂ / ∂r (r2 ∂T / ∂r ) + q / k = 0 which on rearranging gives: ∂ / ∂r (r2 ∂T / ∂r ) = - (q / k) r2 Integrating the above equation once with respect to r: r2 ∂T / ∂r = - (q / 3k) r3 + c where c is constant of integration. Diving both the sides of above equation by r2 : ∂T / ∂r = - (q / 3k) r + c / r2 Integrating again we get: T (r) = - (q / 6k) r2 - c / r + d where d is another constant of integration. The following boundar conditions can be used to obtain the constants c and d : at r = 0 ; T has a finite value. This can only be possible if c = 0. at r = 0 ; T = To (finite value of temperature) Using these in the temperature equation; We get; c = 0 ; d = To ; Substituting these in the equation: T (r) = - (q / 6k) r2 + To which is the required expression.
