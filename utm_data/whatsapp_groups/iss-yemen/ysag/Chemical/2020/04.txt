4/3/20, 1:33 PM - +60 11-2173 8331: *| FEEDBACK ON SCEE ONLINE LEARNING |*

Assalamualaikum, 你好, வணக்கம், and greetings to all SKT fellow members.

With the implementation of online learning on 1st April 2020 due to the Movement Control Order, we would like to ask, how was your online learning experience so far?

We, from the Student Representative Council for School of Chemical and Energy Engineering, would to invite you to provide us your feedback on your online learning experience. Any questions, solutions or feedback are highly appreciated. The result of this feedback survey will be compiled in a comprehensive report and provided to the school management for further action. 

Thank you for your cooperation and take care! 

 *This form is only for SCEE (SKT) students.*

4/15/20, 6:49 PM - انس الشيخ: سؤال 2 👍

بس سؤال ثلاثة🤔
4/15/20, 6:50 PM - محمد المريسي: ايش فيه
4/15/20, 6:50 PM - محمد المريسي: We have to obtain the temperature profile for heat generation in radial direction at steady state.

This means that we have a 1 D heat conduction problem with heat generation. Since we are concerned with radial directions we have θ and Φ symmetry. This means that no temperature gradient in Φ and θ direction.

Simplifications:

Steady state means ∂T / ∂t = 0

θ symmetry : ∂T / ∂θ = 0

Φ symmetry : ∂2T / ∂Φ2 = 0

These simplifications reduces the equation to:

(1 / r2) ∂ / ∂r (r2 ∂T / ∂r ) + q / k = 0

which on rearranging gives:

∂ / ∂r (r2 ∂T / ∂r ) = - (q / k) r2

Integrating the above equation once with respect to r:

r2 ∂T / ∂r = - (q / 3k) r3 + c

where c is constant of integration.

Diving both the sides of above equation by r2 :

∂T / ∂r = - (q / 3k) r + c / r2

Integrating again we get:

T (r) = - (q / 6k) r2 - c / r + d

where d is another constant of integration.

The following boundar conditions can be used to obtain the constants c and d :

at r = 0 ; T has a finite value. This can only be possible if c = 0.

at r = 0 ; T = To (finite value of temperature)

Using these in the temperature equation;

We get;

c = 0 ;

d = To ;

Substituting these in the equation:

T (r) = - (q / 6k) r2 + To

which is the required expression.
