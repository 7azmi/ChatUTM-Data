### Review Content

*   **Dr. Nik Noordini:** She rarely responds on WhatsApp. The best way to reach her is to go to her office.

*   **PROF IR DR SHARUL KAMAL BIN ABDUL RAHIM:** One student describes him as "terrible" and claims he fails many students with poor grades even in easy courses. However, others who stayed in his section found him to be "kind," "legendary," and "helpful," achieving A grades and recommending him.

*   **Dr. Lukman Hafiz:** Students are advised not to take courses with him.

*   **Dr. Nor Aini:** She is very responsive on WhatsApp. Students recommended going to her office on the 5th floor for signatures.

*   **Dr. Zaid:** One student warned that if you take a course with him, you will probably forget you are taking it. He will forget he is teaching. His class receives A's

*   **Dr. Fatin Nadiah Binti Mohamed Yussof:** She explains well, does not focus on attendance, and helps with grades if students attend and try. Her weakness is that she may not have very in-depth knowledge of the subject matter, but this is not a problem for Math 1.

*   **SITI RAHMAH BINTI ABDULLAH:** One student describes her as good.

*   Regarding a Math 1 professor: Assignments and quizzes are set up so that students can achieve full marks. The lecturer is nice but the explanations are poor. However, he tries to help and explain individually if asked. He is very strict about attendance.

*   **Siti Norriam Norrulashikin**: Described as a boring lecturer that does not communicate by WhatsApp or phone. He expects students to attend lectures. If the professor is more than 30 minutes late, the class is canceled. There are a lot of assignments, almost every lecture.

*   **Dr. Arnidza:** Students found her okay, with weak explanations but not bad grading. Assignment grades were good (8 or 9 out of 10). She taught Digital Electronics. Attendance was not heavily emphasized during a semester that was partially online and partially in person.

*   **Dr Norlaili:** Very good.

### Key Details

*   Contact information for several lecturers shared.
*   Conflicting opinions exist regarding PROF IR DR SHARUL KAMAL BIN ABDUL RAHIM.
*   Emphasis on contacting lecturers through their office rather than WhatsApp.
*   Importance of attendance for some lecturers (unspecified names).
*   Some lecturers give easy grades or help students.

### Additional Context
