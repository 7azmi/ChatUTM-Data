IT support is available to online learners just as it is to those studying on-campus.\n\nHowever, as online learners in our Open Distance Program, user must at least use a computer with similar or higher than Intel Pentium CPU N4200 1.10GHZ (4CPUs), dual Core and 4.0 Gigabyte RAM specification to have a positive experience while using the ODL system, . Users also need a high internet bandwidth, recommended 1Mbits download and 0.5 Mbits upload speed.\n\n\n\n#### Virtual Private Network (VPN) UTM\n\nUniversiti Teknologi Malaysia created a virtual [point-to-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(network_topology) \"Point-to-point (network topology)\")\n connection through the use of dedicated connections for our remote students. Our online distance learners can download resources available within the private network through UTM virtual private network (VPN) using registered UTM id via the following link.\n\n[vpn.utm.my](https://vpn.utm.my/)\n\n\n\n#### Check your computer set-up\n\nYou can use the following links to test that your computer is set up correctly.\n\n[Test your internet speed connection (Speedtest.net)](http://www.speedtest.net/)\n\n[How to check computer RAM (WikiHow website)](https://www.wikihow.com/Check-Computer-RAM)\n\n[How to check your storage space (WikiHow website)](https://www.wikihow.com/Check-Your-Hard-Disk-Space)\n\n\n\n#### Supported Web Browser\n\nYou will need to check that your website browser is supported by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia to access the Open Distance Learning System.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Platform** | **Browser(s)** |\n| **Windows 11** | Firefox 60 ESR, Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Chrome |\n| **Windows 10** | Firefox 60 ESR, Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Chrome |\n| **Windows 7** | Firefox 60 ESR, Internet Explorer 11, Chrome |\n| **Mac OS X** | Firefox 60 ESR, Chrome |\n| **Linux (Scientific Linux 6 and 7)** | Firefox 60 ESR |\n\nThe supported Firefox versions are based on the Extended Support Release (ESR) versions Firefox provides.\n\nWindows XP is no longer supported, therefore no browser support on the Windows XP platform.\n\nNo specific Chrome version is supported due to the nature of Chrome releases.\n\nNo specific Edge version is supported due to the nature of the Windows 10 releases."
