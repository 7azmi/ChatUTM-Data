The one thing that made me decide to enroll in this program was the process of applying for this program, the class schedule which was done after working hours online including the examination was implemented without the requirement to show up to the campus. It did help much financially and so much more.\n\nJoerymy Epi Justin\n\nMaster of Forensic Engineering\n\nThere have been ups and downs throughout the learning process in ODL. Studying while working is indeed a challenge. However, learning through the ODL system allowed everyone to learn and network beyond boundaries. Lecturers’ efforts in making classes engaging despite participants being only virtually present are much appreciated. Not forgetting the good and tough times we had with groupmates of different backgrounds certainly tested our leadership and broaden our horizons. Frequent activities on campus with online accessibility and the inclusion of ODL students in competitions such as CAPSIM allow us to practice and showcase what we have learned throughout the course. Glad to be able to experience all this despite being more than 1,400 km apart in the same country.\n\nHow Tien Jack\n\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\n\nThis ODL program is a good platform for making my dream come true to further my studies despite facing great challenges due to time constraints with work and family schedules. The line of lecturers who are very experienced and always open to help inspired me to finish my studies on time. I was also very lucky to be guided by a supervisor who never gave up on teaching and pushing me with encouragement and motivation until I created a thesis, I never thought I could produce.\n\nNur Farhana Binti Mustahidin\n\nMaster of Education (Education Technology)\n\n### WHAT IS ODL\n\nOpen and Distance Learning (ODL) is a way of learning remotely without being in regular face-to-face contact with instructor in the classroom.\n\nOpen and Distance Learning at UTM offers a new way of combining innovative learning and teaching techniques with interaction with your lecturer and students from around the world.\n\nOur program offers learning delivery completely online. Online courses offer students the flexibility of studying from anywhere and at any time over the Internet.\n\n### Why ODL\n\nOur courses structured as online meetings virtually through our online learning management system. Class sizes are kept small (capped at 20 students) to maximize interaction between students and instructor.\n\nAn online Master’s program may be exactly what you need to complete your degree and improve your scope. Our Masters programs provide an opportunity for students to obtain a great deal of knowledge and more in-depth study in your chosen field. In other cases, you can embrace a complimentary, but different course of study to gather a new prospective and potentially new work paths. In all cases, obtaining an online Masters degree is one of the best opportunities available to today’s student.\n\n#### UTM OPEN AND DISTANCE LEARNING IMPORTANT DATE FOR NEW STUDENT REGISTRATION SEMESTER II 2024/2025 New\n\n![](https://odl.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/sites/190/2025/03/PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_1.png \"PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_1\")\n\n![](https://odl.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/sites/190/2025/03/PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_2.png \"PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_2\")\n\n![](https://odl.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/sites/190/2025/03/PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_3.png \"PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_3\")\n\n![](https://odl.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/sites/190/2025/03/PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_4.png \"PG-TAUGHT-COURSE-MIXED-MODE-WORK-SCHEDULE-FOR-POSTGRADUATE-SEM-II-SHORT-SEM-20242025-SESSION_Page_4\")\n\n**UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA**  \n81310 Skudai,  \nJohor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia.  \nPhone : +6 07 5537893  \nEmail : [graduate@utm.my](mailto:graduate@utm.my)  \nOffice Hours : Mon – Fri (8:00 am – 5:00 pm)  \nWebsite : [utm.my](https://odl.utm.my/utm.my)\n\n**UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA KUALA LUMPUR**  \nJalan Sultan Yahya Petra,  \n54100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  \nPhone : +6 03-2615 4100  \nEmail : [corporate.kl@utm.my](mailto:corporate.kl@utm.my)  \nOffice Hours : Mon – Fri (8:00 am – 5:00 pm)  \nWebsite : [kl.utm.my](https://odl.utm.my/kl.utm.my)\n\n**UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA PAGOH**  \nJalan Edu Hub UTM 2,  \nHub Pendidikan Tinggi Pagoh,  \n84600 Pagoh, Johor, Malaysia  \nPhone : +6 06-9742888  \nEmail : [ica-utmpagoh@utm.my](mailto:ica-utmpagoh@utm.my)\n  \nOffice Hours : Mon – Fri (8:00 am – 5:00 pm)  \nWebsite : [pagoh.utm.my](https://odl.utm.my/pagoh.utm.my)\n\nNumber of Visitors\n\n[![website counter code](https://counter9.whocame.ovh/private/freecounterstat.php?c=cwplkencwkl1gz4dgreyhder27st2mc9 \"website counter code\")](https://www.freecounterstat.com/)"
