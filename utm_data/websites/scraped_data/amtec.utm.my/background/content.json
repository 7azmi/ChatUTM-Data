Upon the organisation restructuring, the research unit has been moved to UTM Skudai in 2002.In 2008, AMTEC has been upgraded as one of the centres of excellence (CoE) in UTM. AMTEC is known as a regional and international referral centre for advanced membrane technology and applications. The vision of AMTEC is to become a hub of membrane-based technology for nation human capital development and wealth creation and its mission is to establish as a world-renown centre of excellence in research development and commercialization. The centre is established to generate new and exciting research projects, to provide a centre for research activities related to membrane-based technology, to build research networks with research universities and industries in Malaysia and worldwide, to provide opportunities for research collaboration and facilities for visiting researchers, and to train new generations of postgraduate students in the field of membrane-based technology. \n\nIn November 2015, AMTEC has been officially recognized as  the Higher Institution Centres of Excellence (HiCoE) in the niche of Water Reclamation by the Ministry of Higher Education. With the acknowledgement as HiCoE, extensive network and partnership with various institutions and agencies locally and internationally are established to contribute towards water reclamation development. AMTEC represents vehicles for researchers and postgraduate students to undertake multidisciplinary research that are internationally recognized and meeting global standard in the area of membrane technology for water reclamation. All members in AMTEC have initiate and lead several joint research projects with local and international universities and industries. The knowledge and findings from these collaboration research projects have contributed to the research findings that benefit to humankind and environment. As part of the recognition to the efforts and outputs in research, development and innovation activities, several inventions of AMTEC members have been awarded in local and international level. In addition, AMTEC members have actively involved in translational research that has a positive impact to the community. This is to ensure that the outcome of the research can be a solution to the national and global issues. AMTEC is also one of the collaborative partners for the organization of the International Conference on Membrane Science & Technology (MST) which is held biannually. This event highlights the advances and new findings in membrane science & technology and their impacts on technology development. \n\nVision\n======\n\nTo become a hub of membrane – based technology for nation human\n\ncapital development and wealth creation\n\nMission\n=======\n\nTo establish AMTEC as a world – renown centre of excellence in Research, Development and Innovation (R & D & I)\n\n[](https://amtec.utm.my/background#)\n\n \n\nResearch Ecosystem\n\n[Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](https://www.utm.my/)\n [UTM Nexus -
