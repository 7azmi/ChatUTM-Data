It combines research in engineering which incorporates training in business with management skills into developing innovative solutions to technological products or processes.\n\nThe Eng.Doc graduates will have equivalent doctoral-level qualification with more industrially-based focused than the conventional Doctor of Philosophy. Research which aimed in solving real problems are able to make decisions inclusive of technical knowledge, business management and opportunity and contribute to innovative solutions\n\n[MQA](https://www2.mqa.gov.my/mqr/english/epapariptaAA.cfm?IDAkrKP=15039)\n\n###### **Programme Educational
