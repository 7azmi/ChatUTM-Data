The strengthening of the knowledge contained in this postgraduate program encompasses product design, mechanical systems and electrical systems that aims to produce expert graduates who can develop innovative solutions of a system or product by taking into account the benefits of the community and the preservation of the environment.\n\nIn addition to core courses, the program provides three elective fields; mechanical system design, product design and electronic system design. These three electives comprise the current engineering requirements. The program also offers methods, models and tools for designing mechanical products and designing industrial management systems. Technical, humanitarian and economic factors are also taken into account to strengthen the course outcomes. The rapidly growing microelectronic technology, regardless of the world’s economic climate, requires experienced engineers and knowledgeable technologists. Graduates acquired knowledge of integrating intelligent control systems and mechanical and electronic devices to produce innovative consumer products.\n\nCareer in product design requires the knowledge of producing products that meet the needs of the users, consumers and the community. The fast growing of product generation is now a priority. Candidates will be exposed to the processes and elements involved in the development of a product such as creativity impulse and management methods.\n\n[MQA](https://www2.mqa.gov.my/mqr/english/epapariptaAA.cfm?IDAkrKP=18856)\n\n###### **Programme Educational Objectives**\n\nThis program will produce graduates who are able to:\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Demonstrate the engineering design knowledge obtained from this program when creating innovative solutions to industry-related problems (Knowledge – thinking skills and practical skills).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Exhibit effective communication skill among multi-disciplinary team members.(Communication, team work, social skills).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Uphold professional ethics when executing responsibilities and taking into account society, environment and global issues.
