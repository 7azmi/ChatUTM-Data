Through a series of design-projects, which is the core of the curriculum, the students get to go through a creative problem-solving design attitude. This inculcates the attitude that evokes interest in applicable know-how and skills. The curriculum is balanced in such a way that knowledge and skills learned through courses can almost immediately be applied in the product design project.\n\nThe industrial design is a four-year programme. There is an internship in the third year with a company locally and planning abroad. The education model we apply at Industrial Design Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics is unique in Malaysia. Students will work in a simulated professional design environment, where they work in groups and individuals. The students are also given related individual assignments. About 80% of the student’s time is spent on the core courses, about 20% on university compulsory courses in which students acquire basic knowledge and skills. The programme course consists of basic training and subsequently specialisation in different areas.\n\nStudents are thoroughly introduced to the design profession in the first year, so they will find out quite quickly whether they are suited to it or not. All students develop a digital portfolio detailing their experience during the course of their studies showing what they have created or learnt. Students are graded on their portfolios and formal examinations. Successful completion of the programme in Industrial Design results in Bachelor of Science with Honours Industrial Design.\n\n[MQA](https://www2.mqa.gov.my/mqr/english/epapariptaAA.cfm?IDAkrKP=18290)\n\n###### **Programme Educational Objectives**\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)To produce graduates who are knowledgeable and technically competent in industrial design discipline contributing to industrial growth.\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)To produce graduates who can communicate effectively, demonstrate leadership qualities and manage design projects in an organisation.\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)To produce graduates who are capable of solving design problems innovatively, creatively and ethically through a sustainable approach.\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)To produce graduates who are able to practise life-long learning for successful career advancement and are aware of entrepreneurship opportunities.\n\n###### **Learning Outcomes**\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to discuss, articulate and apply knowledge in relation to culture, environment, technology, manufacturing and practice in industrial design and the related field (KW).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to apply techniques, skills and theories of design, communication, technology, environment, culture and practice into industrial design work (AP).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to apply techniques and skills in prototyping, drawings, drafting and computer modelling into industrial design work (PS).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to convey ideas, express rationale, and provide solutions clearly in written, verbal and graphic in an appropriate form for a given audience (CS).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to identify, analyse and evaluate and solve issues or design problems, issues, or tasks by integrating knowledge in design, to conclude and produce alternative solutions (TS/TH).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to identify, analyse and evaluate and solve issues or design problems, issues, or tasks by integrating knowledge in design, to conclude and produce alternative solutions (TS/TH).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to interact, collaborate and negotiate responsibly within a team of colleagues and/or community (TW).Ability to demonstrate ethical values in executing tasks and projects to safeguard the development of the society and environment (GC).\n\n![](https://fai.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fast-forward_4662135.png)Ability to acquire resources, select, retrieve, evaluate, and manage information from various sources;
