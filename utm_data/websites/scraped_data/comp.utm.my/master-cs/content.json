The full-time programme is offered only at the UTM Main Campus in Johor Bahru. The duration of study for the full-time programme is subjected to the student’s entry qualifications and lasts to a maximum of four (4) years.\n\nThe programme is offered on full-time and is based on a 2-Semester per academic session.
