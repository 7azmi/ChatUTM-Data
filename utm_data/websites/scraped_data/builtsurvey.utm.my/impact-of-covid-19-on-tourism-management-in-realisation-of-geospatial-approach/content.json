FABU had invited Tokyo Metropolitan University, UUM, and FRIM as the organizer of the OGC.\n\nThe OGC had organised a talk entitled “Impact of COVID-19 on Tourism Management in Realisation of Geospatial approach” by two invited speakers, Dr. Huda Farhana Mohamad Muslim from Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) and Dr. Muna Maryam Azmy from Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM).\n\nThe talk was participated by 110 persons involving students and staff from Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The talk had focused on the utilization of a geospatial approach in improving nature tourism specifically due to the impact of pandemic COVID-19.\n\nIn the talk, Dr. Muna Maryam highlighted the current situation of tourism management generally in Malaysia during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Dr. Noordyana from FABU emphasised geospatial practice to improve nature tourism management during the pandemic.\n\n![](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/sqHOvZnbZwuEm9UM-56s1W4IYTxfsgXgnI-NJr3Yk5Jbvj7MPVUjYknbzveLZbduTzrcwYkZRp8q8W99JGom83yUlHHf2BjgzykAPEuoKeY=s0-d-e1-ft#https://news.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Picture2-2.jpg)\n\n_During Questions and Answers session_\n\nAccording to the geospatial framework presented by Dr. Noordyana, community services would be one of the approaches to educating the community regarding the use of the geospatial approach. Thus, Dr. Huda Farhana delivered the example of community services that she has experienced. The participants had participated actively during the Questions and Answers session before ending the OGC.\n\nPrepared by: Noordyana binti Hassan"
