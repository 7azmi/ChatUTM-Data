Prof. Dr. Alice Sabrina Ismail\n\n![](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/4sL9WAoJnZsnoSJKBZ7iq8mGXxUqOCwNrhe4I7qVVGQW_6w7mLG6GvusoUeiTXlvglyEMj7tP_h1BRn9x0ewnejPM6L0w9OuaaRWDS0OLLY=s0-d-e1-ft#https://news.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-1024x535.png)\n\nThe UTM Architecture Program has successfully conducted five series of International Architecture Webinars online.\n\nThe webinars gathered prominent experts from the architecture field and related design disciplines to discuss a wide range of issues faced by the present societies from different continents.\n\nThese five webinar series was conducted on the 1st November 2021 (1st Webinar Series); 15th November 2021 (2nd Webinar Series); 23rd November 2021 (3rd Webinar Series); 20th December 2021 (4th Webinar Series), and 28th December 2021 (5th Webinar Series).\n\nThese five Webinar Series involved five lecturers from the program of Architecture UTM and ten lecturers from five universities representing four countries: Indonesia, India, United Kingdom and Spain.\n\nThese five universities are Vellore Institute of Technology and Sasi Creative School of Architecture, Chennai, India; University of Alicante, Spain; Sheffield University, United Kingdom and Universitas Tanjungpura, Kalimantan, Indonesia.\n\nThese five international webinar series have attracted many audiences and participants worldwide, locally and abroad, providing new exposure and knowledge dimension discussing real-life matters faced by developed and well-developed nations.\n\nAn estimation of thousand participants attended these five online webinar series. The responses were optimistic and overwhelming.\n\nEach webinar series session, which took about 4 hours, did impact the architecture students and triggered new thinking approaches for them to have intelligent design solutions.\n\nThis activity increases collaboration and peers learning among students and academicians, which is valuable in building linkages and strengthening the relationship between the UTM architecture program and prominent international universities.\n\nPositive feedbacks given by the participants motivate the UTM Architecture program to organize more international webinar series in the future.\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)"
