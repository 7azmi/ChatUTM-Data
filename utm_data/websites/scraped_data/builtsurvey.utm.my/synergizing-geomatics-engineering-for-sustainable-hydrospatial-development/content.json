It includes tasks such as data collection, analysis, interpretation, visualisation and dissemination of data on underwater features and the marine environment. This information is crucial for navigation, resource management, environmental monitoring and disaster prevention. Therefore, this article explores the intricate link between geomatics engineering and sustainable hydrospatial development and shows how innovative methodologies and data-driven approaches are reshaping our understanding and management of the aquatic environment.\n\n[https://news.utm.my/ms/2024/03/synergizing-geomatics-engineering-for-sustainable-hydrospatial-development/](https://news.utm.my/ms/2024/03/synergizing-geomatics-engineering-for-sustainable-hydrospatial-development/)"
