Petroleum engineering Programme covers formation evaluation, reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, well completion, well treatment and diagnosis, and production engineering. Besides that, the Programme requires a good knowledge of other related disciplines, namely geophysics, petroleum geology, petroleum project economics and management, engineering safety, etc.\n\n**Read more…**\n\nUTM’s undergraduate Petroleum Engineering Programme was the first Petroleum Engineering Programme offered in this country by the Department of Petroleum Engineering, UTM way back in 1975. The goal of the Programme is to provide undergraduate students with a world-class petroleum engineering education that will equip them with the technical and generic skills as required by the global oil and gas industry. Our undergraduate Programme is fully accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Council (EAC) and Washington Accord. In addition, the Programme has also been benchmarked against ABET Programme criteria for petroleum and similarly named engineering Programmes, Society of Petroleum Engineering competency matrix for Petroleum Engineers, and six ABET-accredited institutions of higher learning in the United States of America (USA).\n\nPetroleum engineering graduates are involved in the wide spectrum of the exploration and production business; from making discoveries and developing reservoirs to optimizing production and making commercial evaluations, determining the drilling methods to be used, and monitoring the drilling and production activities. They also work on designing tools and operational procedures in order to gain efficiency in the recovery of oil and gas. Simulation Programmes are used extensively by petroleum engineers to determine the best possible method of recovery of petroleum from different reservoirs. Models and designs of drilling and other equipment are also simulated on computers. The aim is to maximize hydrocarbon recovery at minimum cost while maintaining a strong emphasis on reducing environmental impact.\n\nOver the years, we have been assisted by experienced advisory panels from oil and gas industry and renowned universities in improving our academic curriculum so that it is of high quality and relevant to the needs of oil and gas industry. Industry practitioners are invited every semester to give professional talks to all petroleum students on latest technology and contemporary oil and gas related issues. There are numerous opportunities for our students to participate in student organizations. The Society of Petroleum Engineers’ Student Chapter (SPE-UTM) has been among the most active in the Asia-Pacific region over the past few years. The presence of international students from Kazakhstan, Yemen, Somalia, Singapore, Nigeria, China, Sudan, Indonesia, Iran, Uganda, Indonesia, etc. at the Department of Petroleum Engineering has further complemented our effort in producing well-rounded petroleum graduates who are ready to face the challenges in global oil and gas industry.\n\n*   [Programme Specifications](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Programme Educational Objectives (PEO)](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Programme Learning Outcomes (PLO)](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Program Structure](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Engineering Programme Accreditation](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Career opportunities](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Entry requirement](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n*   [Graduation Checklist](https://fkt.utm.my/bachelor-of-petroleum-eng#)\n    \n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.   Programme Name | Bachelor of Petroleum Engineering with Honours |     |\n| 2.   Final Award | Bachelor of Petroleum Engineering with Honours |     |\n| 3.   Awarding Institution | Universiti Teknologi Malaysia |     |\n| 4.   Teaching Institution | Universiti Teknologi Malaysia |     |\n| 5.   Professional or Statutory Body of Accreditation | Engineering Accreditation Council (EAC) Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM) |     |\n| 6.   Language(s) of Instruction | English and Malay |     |\n| 7.   Mode of Study (Conventional, distance learning, etc) | Conventional |     |\n| 8.   Mode of operation (Franchise, self-govern, etc) | Self-governing |     |\n| 9.   Study Scheme (Full Time/Part Time) | Full Time |     |\n| 10\\.

They can be assigned in various companies; working for major, fully-integrated international oil companies, smaller independent operators, specialized companies that provide services for the producing companies, or consulting firms in oil and gas or the environmental arena. Among the oil and gas companies are Petronas, Exxonmobil, Shell, Talisman, Murphy Oil, Newfield, Petrofac, Hess Oil, Nippon Oil, and Newfield, while the oil-related service providers are Schlumberger, Haliburton, Baker Hughes, UMW Drilling, Geowell, Dimension Bid, Dialog, and Scomi. As a petroleum engineer, you can expect to earn the highest starting salary among all the engineers. Salaries for petroleum engineers are, and will continue to be, among the highest paid of all professionals. We genuinely care about our students and their future. Over the last few decades, our graduates have been serving the society in key positions and have made tremendous impact to the development of Malaysia.\n\nSeveral worldwide trends, namely exploring deep-water fields, development of marginal fields, implementation of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Programmes, etc., ensure that the strong demand for petroleum engineers will continue. The ever-increasing population of the Earth, when combined with the growing thirst for energy in the developing countries, is putting significant upward pressure on the demand for oil and gas production. This increasing demand for energy, and the simple fact that oil and gas resources are limited, places the petroleum engineer in a strong position now and for many years to come.\n\n**Malaysian**\n\n[https://admission.utm.my/undergraduate-malaysian/](https://admission.utm.my/undergraduate-malaysian/ \"Malaysian\")\n\n**International**\n\n[https://admission.utm.my/undergraduate-international/](https://admission.utm.my/undergraduate-international/ \"International\")\n\n**For further enquiries please contact:**\n\n![Dr. Wan Rosli Wan Sulaiman](https://fkt.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Dr-Anam.png)    **Assoc.
