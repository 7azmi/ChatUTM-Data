These programmes provide candidates with the opportunity to further their studies and to achieve academic maturity via novel research work in the area of polymer engineering. The global challenges faced by the industry have increased the demand for new and innovative materials, how to select, combine, process and recycle them. Therefore there has been a growing demand for polymer engineer to work in polymer industries covers plastics, rubber and composite to support plastics operations in Malaysia.\n\n**Read more…**\n\n**Benefits:**  \nStudents studying for a postgraduate research degree in Polymer Engineering work on projects of real-world significance, which feed into improvements in life for everyone.
