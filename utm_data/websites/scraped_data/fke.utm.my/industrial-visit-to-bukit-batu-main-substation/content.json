The visit was conducted at Bukit Batu Main Substation, Kulai, Johor. The main objectives of the visit to Bukit Batu Main Substation were to allow the students to gain exposure on electrical industries and be aware of the responsibilities as electrical engineers. The visit was necessary for the students to fulfill part of the requirements for completing the subject “Introduction to Electrical Engineering”, where at the end of the 12-week course, the students were expected to be able to (i) analyse and describe the responsibilities of engineers to the society; (ii) explain the importance of sustainable solutions; (iii) be accountable on assigned tasks in an ethical manner; and (iv) manage a project. The visit to Bukit Batu Main Substation was fruitful for the students where the students had the chance to visit various high voltage technologies used at the substation. UTM FKE wishes to thank Mdm Siti Mariam and the personnel from Bukit Batu Main Substation for entertaining the visit.\n\n![pmu-bukit-batu2](https://fke.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PMU-Bukit-Batu2.jpg)\n\nGroup photo\n\n\\# Dr. Noor Azlinda Ahmad, Institute of High Voltage and High Current, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.\n\nClose this module\n\n![](https://fke.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CSI-FKE-2025-1.jpeg)\n\n[ENTER](https://forms.gle/cY3JjRxyTnPs4CnXA)\n\n[Never see this message again.](https://fke.utm.my/industrial-visit-to-bukit-batu-main-substation#)"
