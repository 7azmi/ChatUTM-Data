The visit was conducted at Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering (MMHE), Pasir Gudang, Johor. The main objectives of the visit to MMHE were to allow the students to gain exposure on electrical industries and be aware of the responsibilities as electrical engineers. The visit was necessary for the students to fulfill part of the requirements for completing the subject “Introduction to Electrical Engineering”, where at the end of the 12-week course, the students were expected to be able to (i) analyse and describe the responsibilities of engineers to the society; (ii) explain the importance of sustainable solutions; (iii) be accountable on assigned tasks in an ethical manner; and (iv) manage a project. The visit to MMHE was fruitful for the students where the students had the chance to visit various shipping processes and technologies at MMHE. UTM FKE wishes to thank Ms. Azilah Yunos and the personnel from MMHE for entertaining the visit.\n\n![mmhe](https://fke.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MMHE.jpg)\n\nStudents visiting MMHE.\n\n\\# Assoc.
