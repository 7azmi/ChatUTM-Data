The shielded room is a complimentary gift from Telekom Research and Development in Cyberjaya Selangor. The installation of the shielded room is carried out by the research group’s members and faculty’s assistance engineer. The shielded room installation is expected to be completed by the end of July. The setting up of the shielded room will benefit researches as well as many different tests of application such as Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), Conductive test chambers, Reverberation chambers, semi Anechoic chambers, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) rooms and the likes.\n\n![](https://fke.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/art34-1.png)\n\n![](https://fke.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/art34-2.png)\n\n* * *\n\n**Shielded room in Advanced Microwave and Antenna Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering.**\n\n* * *\n\n[HOME](https://fke.utm.my/comm/)\n\n* * *\n\nClose this module\n\n![](https://fke.utm.my/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CSI-FKE-2025-1.jpeg)\n\n[ENTER](https://forms.gle/cY3JjRxyTnPs4CnXA)\n\n[Never see this message again.](https://fke.utm.my/installation-of-the-new-rf-shielded-room-in-advanced-microwave-and-antenna-laboratory#)"
