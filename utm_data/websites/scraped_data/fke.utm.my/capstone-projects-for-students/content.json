The project, with the course code SKEE 4722, provides the students with the opportunity to integrate technical knowledge and generic skills attained in their earlier years. This is to be achieved within the context of an engineering project conducted in a small team (typically three or four students) under the supervision of an academic staff and with optional of industry partner, as the advisor. Topics supplementing this course that include project management tools and practices, organizational structures, engineering standards as well as the social and environmental responsibility of professional engineers are covered in the Professional Ethics and/or Engineering Management courses offered prior to or concurrent with the course.
