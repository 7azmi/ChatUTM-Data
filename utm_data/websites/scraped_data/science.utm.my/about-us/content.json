At the beginning the School of Science handled the teaching of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics for the Faculty of Engineering at the National Institute of Technology (ITK). In the same year the Diploma in Science and Education was created under the USP’s control in collaboration with the Ministry of Education. The PPS was upgraded as a Faculty with the name of the Faculty of Science (FS) in 1981. In 1987 the Faculty of Science began conducting the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Science (SSI) course with the offering of courses in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. The following year, 1988, the Faculty of Science moved to Skudai Campus, Johor. Afterwards the FS has undergone many improvements in academic terms, facilities, staff and students.\n\nFS restructuring establishes four major departments namely the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Physics, Department of Biosciences and the Department of Mathematical Sciences, with the addition of three Research Institute under Ibnu Sina Institute for Scientific and Industrial Research (ISI-SIR), the Centre for Sustainable Nanomaterials(CSNano), UTM Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (UTM-CIAM) and the Laser Centre. The Faculty of Science offers pre-graduate and postgraduate programs with courses of study and research work modes. FS has a clear mission and vision in enriching the intellectual property of science and mathematics. FS is also important in the network of education systems at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and has contributed significantly in science and mathematics.\n\nThe vision and mission of the Faculty of Science align harmoniously with the vision and mission of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.\n\n[![](http://science.utm.my/quality/wp-content/uploads/sites/632/2023/03/Q1-misi-visi-scaled.jpg
